                <p>The Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts) is a prominent cultural center in Mexico City.
                    It
                    has hosted some of the most notable events in music, dance, theatre, opera and literature and
                    has
                    held important exhibitions of painting, sculpture and photography. Consequently, the Palacio de
                    Bellas Artes has been called the "Cathedral of Art in Mexico". The building is located on the
                    western side of the historic center of Mexico City next to the Alameda Central park.</p>

                <p class="title">Mercado de Sonora</p>
                <p>Mercado de Sonora (Sonora Market) is a city-established traditional market, located just
                    southeast of
                    the historic center of Mexico City in the Colonia Merced Balbuena neighborhood. It was
                    established
                    in the 1950s with a number of other similar institutions in order to help regulate retail
                    commerce
                    in the city. This market has specialized in a variety of merchandise such as pottery, party
                    items,
                    and live animals — and the two which make it notable, herbal medicine and items related to magic
                    and
                    the occult.</p>

                <p class="title">Museo Frida Kahlo</p>
                <p>As one explores Frida Kahlo’s work more deeply and enjoys the privilege of getting to know her
                    home,
                    one begins to discover the intense interrelations between Frida, her work, and her house. Her
                    creative universe is to be found in the Blue House, the place where she was born and where she
                    died.
                    Following her marriage to Diego Rivera, Frida lived in different places in Mexico City and
                    abroad,
                    but she always returned to her family home in Coyoacán.</p>

                <p>The National Autonomous University of Mexico (Spanish: Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,
                    UNAM)
                    is a public research university in Mexico. It ranks highly in world rankings based on the
                    university's extensive research and innovation. UNAM's campus is a UNESCO World Heritage site.
                    Murals in the main
                    campus were painted by some of the most recognized artists in Mexican history, such as Diego
                    Rivera
                    and David Alfaro Siqueiros. All Mexican
                    Nobel laureates are either alumni or faculty of UNAM.</p>

                    hectares
                    (1,695 acres). Centered on a rock formation called Chapultepec Hill, one of the park's main
                    functions is an ecological space in Greater Mexico City. It is considered the first and most
                    important of Mexico City's "lungs", with trees that replenish oxygen to the Valley of Mexico.
